                <p> When you begin to think about it, it should come to no surprise some of the most valuable locations within cities
                are in areas that are highly walkable. Liveable desirable communities prioritize safe and convienent transportation whether it be
                by walking or bicycling. Unfortunately though, each year roughly 19% of traffic fatalities involve pedestrians and cyclists,
                averaging out to about 6,000 pedestrian deaths annually and 850+/- cyclist deaths. There are additional statistics capturing those
                injured but is not the focus for this analysis. Furthermore this analysis uses data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
                Administration.

                <p> We hope to shed light on this steadily increasing problem, as a lack of pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure is lacking as our population grows.
                  It is necessary to consider the success of pedestrianized areas around the country and the world when expanding our city infrastructure.
                  We need to shift the planning to include cycleways and discourage car dependency. Less people on the roads everyday is a win all around 
                  when it comes to curbing pollution (even as cars seek to electrify), as there would be less tire pollution daily.

                  Fatal bicycle crash rates have risen dramatically over the past decade. In 2020, 932 bicyclists were killed on U.S. roads, up from a low of 621
                   in 2010. One reason may be the dominance of pickups and SUVs in the U.S. vehicle fleet. Research consistently shows that such larger vehicles 
                   are more dangerous to bicyclists than cars (IIHS).
