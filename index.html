                <p> When you begin to think about it, it should come to no surprise some of the most valuable locations and vibrant city centers are heavily pedestrianized.
                  These locations within city limits are often usually accessible by cycle. Liveable desirable communities prioritize safe and convienent transportation 
                  whether it be by walking or bicycling. Even though pedestrianized areas only account for 1% of the Land Cover in the US, these
                  pedestrianized areas have been proven to account for 20% of the GDP.</p>

                <p> Unfortunately though, each year roughly 19% of traffic fatalities involve pedestrians and cyclists,
                averaging out to about 6,000 pedestrian deaths annually and 850+/- cyclist deaths. There are additional statistics capturing those that have been
                injured but is not the focus for this analysis. Furthermore this analysis uses data provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
                Administration. </p>

                    We hope to shed light on this steadily increasing problem, as a lack of pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure is lacking as our population grows.
                    It is necessary to consider the success of pedestrianized areas around the country and the world when expanding our city infrastructure.
                    We need to shift the planning to include cycleways and discourage car dependency. Less people on the roads everyday is a win all around 
                    when it comes to curbing pollution (even as cars seek to electrify), as there would be less tire pollution daily.

                    Fatal bicycle crash rates have risen dramatically over the past decade. In 2020, 932 bicyclists were killed on U.S. roads, up from a low of 621
                     in 2010. One reason may be the dominance of pickups and SUVs in the U.S. vehicle fleet. Research consistently shows that such larger vehicles 
                     are more dangerous to bicyclists than cars (IIHS).
