### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona-- Concerned citizen, bike enthusiast, general human who enjoys good city planning with pedestrianized areas that aren't just car centric.
    2. Scenario--Where is the bicycle infrastructure? Where bicycle infrastructure exists are there less accidents? Where bicyclist deaths occur is there are correlation to a lack of bicycle infrastructure?
        Where are there concentrated bicyclists around the country/world? 
2. Requirements Document
    NHTSA has a database that allows users to capture accident information wherein users can narrow in on specifically fatalities. Still kind of early on, to be determined. 
    Gerald and I will have to comb through sources such as the collection created by Cars Destroyed Our Cities (https://www.instagram.com/cars.destroyed.our.cities/?hl=en); this contains locations that have both been overrun by car infrastructure and places that have successfully implemented pedestrianized areas and bicycle infrastructure.
